              An adventurous spirit with a knack for problem-solving, I spent my
              early career soaring high as part of the Airborne Infantry for
              nearly four years. That time instilled in me resilience,
              discipline, and a strong team spirit, which I've carried into
              every blue-collar role since. The diverse experiences on the
              ground, paired with the structure from my military service, have
              helped me develop a deep-seated work ethic and a determination to
              overcome challenges, no matter how difficult.

              As much as I enjoy diving into lines of code and resolving complex
              problems, I'm equally enthusiastic about building relationships.
              With a dash of humor and an easy-going personality, I connect
              seamlessly with people from all walks of life. I believe that a
              diverse, collaborative environment fuels innovative ideas and
              unique problem-solving approaches.

              On my journey into the tech world, I am excited to bring my unique
              mix of experiences, my determination, and my interpersonal skills
              to a future role in web development. Just as I've faced challenges
              head-on in the military and in physical labor, I'm ready to take
              on the complexities and intricacies of code, making the digital
              world more efficient, one program at a time.
